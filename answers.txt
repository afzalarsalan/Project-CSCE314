Workouts.java
1. Enums don't have to declared static since they are static by default just like classes are
public by default
2. A nested class allows for a greater level of abstraction and modularity as well as allowing cleaner refactoring
in the future.
3. We can get the name of the enumeration value by calling the valueOf function of the static enumeration
4. Short-Circuit evaluation makes it so that the ancillary statements in an if statement will be ignored if the first parameter
in an and sequence is false
FileAccess.java
1. A try catch block allows for the controlled handling of erraneous behavior such as files or data not existing.
We need one in the chance case that the file we are trying to read doesn't exist or other I/O problems
2. An exception is an error which inhibits the future execution of the program unless appropriately handled
